# Weather App

Weather app to display temperature of tiped city

## Project Goals

Create an application that:

1. **Uses a free weather API**, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch temperature data.
2. **Provides a clean and user-friendly interface**, displaying:
   - The user-entered city name.
   - The current temperature.
   - A corresponding emoji reflecting the weather condition.
3. **Follows OOP principles**, organizing the code into these classes:
   - `WeatherApi` – handles API requests.
   - `EmojiUI` – manages the UI and displays emojis.
4. **Leverages Laravel Mix** for CSS and JavaScript compilation and module imports.
5. **Uses AJAX requests** to fetch data in real-time.
